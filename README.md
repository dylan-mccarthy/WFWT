Work From Where Tracker

This application is a tracking for assiting with keeping track of where you work during the week.

The primary driver of this is due to the changes from the Australian Tax Office which now requires a documented list of this information.

The application is made up of a Blazor front end with a WebAPI backend. The idea here is that anyone can take this project and build
a frontend for it in what ever langauge they prefer.

Authentication is done using Auth0 for simplicity.

Entityframework Core is used with a Postgres database.
